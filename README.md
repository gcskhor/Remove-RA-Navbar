# Remove-RA-Navbar

A chrome extension that helps to remove pesky navbars and outlines.

Hit the 'H' key to toggle the navbar and outline visibility!

Works on both https://bootcamp.rocketacademy.co/ and https://codingbasics.rocketacademy.co/ pages.

(Note: hiding/revealing will still trigger when the 'h' key is pressed when searching the gitbook.)

Thanks to Jiachen for helping me get started on this!
